# DevOps Glimpse
Shipping code to production is a complex yet essential process in software development. 

It involves various stages, from development and testing to deployment and monitoring, each critical for ensuring that the end product is stable, efficient, and meets user needs. 

Understanding this process is vital for anyone involved in software development and deployment, as it is key to delivering high-quality software in today's fast-paced tech environment.

𝗔 𝗗𝗲𝗲𝗽 𝗗𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗼 𝗖𝗼𝗱𝗲 𝗗𝗲𝗽𝗹𝗼𝘆𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗧𝗼 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗱𝘂𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻:

Imagine a team of developers working on a new feature or a software update. The journey from code development to production involves several key steps.

𝗞𝗲𝘆 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝗴𝗲𝘀 𝗶𝗻 𝗖𝗼𝗱𝗲 𝗗𝗲𝗽𝗹𝗼𝘆𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁:

1. 𝗖𝗼𝗱𝗲 𝗗𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗹𝗼𝗽𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁: Developers write code in a local environment, often using version control systems like Git for collaboration and version tracking and does the unit testing.

2. 𝗖𝗼𝗱𝗲 𝗥𝗲𝘃𝗶𝗲𝘄: Before merging the new code into the main branch, it undergoes a review process for quality assurance, ensuring it meets coding standards and integrates well with existing code.

3. 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗻𝘂𝗼𝘂𝘀 𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗴𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 (𝗖𝗜): The new code is merged into the main branch. Automated tests (unit tests, integration tests, etc.) are run to ensure the new code doesn't break existing functionality.

4. 𝗕𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱: The code is compiled or built into a runnable format, which might include packaging the code and dependencies.

5. 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝗴𝗶𝗻𝗴/𝗧𝗲𝘀𝘁 𝗘𝗻𝘃𝗶𝗿𝗼𝗻𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁: The build is deployed to a staging environment that closely mimics the production environment. Further testing, including user acceptance testing (UAT), is performed.

6. 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗻𝘂𝗼𝘂𝘀 𝗗𝗲𝗽𝗹𝗼𝘆𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁/𝗗𝗲𝗹𝗶𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘆 (𝗖𝗗): Once the code passes all tests and checks in the staging environment, it's ready for deployment to production. Continuous Deployment means this process is automated, whereas Continuous Delivery may require manual approval.

7. 𝗠𝗼𝗻𝗶𝘁𝗼𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗙𝗲𝗲𝗱𝗯𝗮𝗰𝗸: After deployment, the code's performance is continuously monitored. Feedback and data collected from this stage can inform future development cycles.

𝗘𝘅𝗮𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲:

A web development company is launching a new feature for its online platform. The feature's code is first developed and tested locally. After passing code reviews and automated tests in the CI pipeline, it's deployed to a staging server where it undergoes UAT. Upon successful testing and final approval, the feature is rolled out to the production server using a CD tool like Jenkins or CircleCI. Post-deployment, the operations team monitors the feature for any issues or bugs that users might encounter.

𝗖𝗵𝗮𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗻𝗴𝗲𝘀:

The main challenges in this process include ensuring code quality, managing dependencies, handling different environments, and ensuring minimal downtime during deployment.
